		<h1>The Diary of a Madman</h1>

		<div>
		<p><strong>02/19/2017</strong></p>
		<p>Since I've almost accidentally annihilated my previous diary, I have decided to create some kind of my own personal online diary. 
		It can be almost considered as a blog, and maybe it is one indeed, but I couldn't know for sure as I am quite poorly introduced to the modern blog culture.
		For me, it is going to be something like a practice battleground, where I can add new entries about what I have learned alongside with the examples of what I have learned.
		By now, I have already accomplished the HTML course, and almost ready to move on. However, practice makes perfect, as they say.
		So here is where my practice begins. First of all, I am going to add some buttons and different checkboxes, as they were not covered in my tutorial. </p><br/>
		<strong>Things like this are added by printing <span>input type="text"</span></strong><br/>
		<input type="text" name="username"/><br/>
		<p>There is also a "name" attribute, which, I suppose, is added for the future reference</p>
		<strong>Things like this are added by printing <span>input type="password"</span></strong><br/>
		<input type="password" name="password"/><br/>
		<p>You know, if you try printing here, you will see a typical password input. By the way, the name attribute is present here as well.</p><br/>
		<strong>This is done with <span>input type="radio"</span></strong><br/>
		<br/>
		<input type="radio" name="radion" value="1" >First Option<br/>
		<input type="radio" name="radion" value="2">Second Option<br/>
		<p>Accidentally figured out that without adding "name" attribute along with the "value" attribute, these checkboxes will allow to select both of them.</p><br/>
		<strong>And this - with <span>input type="checkbox"</span></strong><br/>
		<br/>
		<input type="checkbox" value="1">Checkbox 1<br/>
		<input type="checkbox" value="2">Checkbox 2<br/>
		<input type="checkbox" value="3">Checkbox 3<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>The button was made with <span>input type="submit" value="Useless button"</span></strong><br/>
		<br/>
		<input type="submit" value="Useless button"><br/>
		</div>

		<p>I already start to doubt my choice to delay my CSS studies to practice HTML a bit. Still, I begin to have a vision of how my website should look like.
		For example, I think I should add <a href="things.html">another webpage</a> (and add it to the menu as well) containing the information about the resources I have checked out and found valuable.
		However, I am too lazy to do it today. But as a bit of my practice, I will start searching for thing I will post below. It should look like this, and I plan to adjust it so that it would allow me to search this page for the existing entries (sounds weird, I know). But that's all for the future. By now, it's just a thing. Also, I guess I should mention that the tag is <span>select name="entries"</span> inside a good old <span>form action</span>. Will dig into that further later. As well as why is all this text looks like <strong>strong</strong>, while the strong tag is 		closed after the date absolutely the same way as in the previous entry (found out there was unclosed "strong" tag from the previous entry). </p>

		<form action="/action_page.php">
 		 <select name="entries">
		    <option value="entry1">02/19/2017</option>
		    <option value="entry2">02/20/2017</option>
		    <option value="entry3">02/21/2017</option>
		    <option value="entry4">02/22/2017</option>
		  </select>
		  <input type="submit" value="Go there">
		</form>

		</div>
		<div>
                <p><strong>02/21/2017</strong></p>
		<p>Added that <a href="things.html">webpage</a> I was talking about yesterday. Wouldn't say anything else quite interesting happened today.</p>               
                </div>

		</div>
                <div>
                <strong>02/22/2017</strong>
                <p>I was running pretty well through the pre-requisite courses that were meant to prepare me for the Ruby on Rails tutorial. The full list included:</br></br>
		<ul>
		<li>Linux CLI</li>
		<li>Text Editor</li>
		<li>GitHub</li>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS & LayOut</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
		<li>Ruby</li>
		<li>Sinatra</li>
		<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
		</ul></br>
		<p>Suddenly, after finishing the HTML course, I accidentally figure out that the CSS one and all the following are under construction (same thing about the one devoted to Vim).
		Guess I'm kinda screwed. Anyway, I guess I should continue to study them, however, from another sources. Just because the show must go on.
		Later that day (thank God I managed to grab some days off) I wasted a significant amount of time to "reroute" all my webpages in HTML to the single CSS document. I mean, linking was simple, the hard part was to make the site look the same way without internal styling.
		Guess I am the winner today. Or the wiener.</p>
