		Since I've almost accidentally annihilated my previous diary, I have decided to create some kind of my own personal online diary. 
		It can be almost considered as blog, and maybe it is, as I am quite poorly introduced to the modern blog culture.
		For me, it gonna be something like a practice battleground, where I add new entries about what I have learned along with the expamples of what I have learned.
		By now, I have already accomplished HTML course, and would be almost ready to move on. However, practice makes perfect, as they say.
		So here is gonna be my practice. First of all, I am going to add some buttons and different checkboxes, as they were not covered in my tutorial. </p><br/>
		<strong>Things like this are added by printing <span style="color: #039;">input type="text"</span></strong><br/>
		<input type="text" name="username"/><br/>
		<p>There is also a "name" attribute, which, I suppose, is added for the future reference</p>
		<strong>Things like this are added by printing <span style="color: #039;">input type="password"</span></strong><br/>
		<input type="password" name="password"/><br/>
		<p>You know, if you try printing here, you will see a typical password input. By the way, the name attribute is present here as well.</p><br/>
		<strong>This is done with <span style="color: #039;">input type="radio"</span></strong><br/>
		<br/>
		<input type="radio" name="radion" value="1" >First Option<br/>
		<input type="radio" name="radion" value="2">Second Option<br/>
		<p>Accidentally figured out that without adding "name" attribute along with the "value" attribute, these checkboxes will allow to select both of them.</p><br/>
		<strong>And this - with <span style="color: #039;">input type="checkbox"</span></strong><br/>
		<br/>
		<input type="checkbox" value="1">Checkbox 1<br/>
		<input type="checkbox" value="2">Checkbox 2<br/>
		<input type="checkbox" value="3">Checkbox 3<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>The button was made with <span style="color: #039;">input type="submit" value="Useless button"</span><br/>
		<br/>
		<input type="submit" value="Useless button"><br/>
		</div>

	</body>
