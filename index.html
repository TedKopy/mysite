	<p style="align: center;">I have not yet decided anything about how would I like my very first complete own website to look like,
					      however, I already feel a necessity to practice some things I learn about(suppose I will have to change this text later).
					      First of all, I guess, I will add some links to the pages that do not even exist yet. Actually, I can leave only buttons on top.</p>
