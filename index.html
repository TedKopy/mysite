	<div><p>I have not yet decided anything about how would I like my very first complete own website to look like,
					      however, I already feel a necessity to practice some things I learn about(suppose I will have to change this text later).
					      First of all, I guess, I will add some links to the pages that do not even exist yet. Actually, I can leave only buttons on top.<br/><br/>
                After some time has passed, I've accidentally figured out that to decide how is your website going to look like is actually the most hard part.
              I still cannot be sure I like its appearance.</p></div>
