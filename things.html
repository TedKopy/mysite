	 <div class="round">
	  <p>Here I will paste some links and references I consider useful. Most of them will also probably deserve some feedback. I decided to put them all in a table.</p>
	 </div>

	<div id="invis">
	<table border="1">
	 <tr>
	  <th>Resource Name</th>
	  <th>Actual link</th>
	  <th>Description</th>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	  <td><span>Sololearn</span></td>
	  <td><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="blank">https://www.sololearn.com/</a></td>
	  <td>It is one of the first resources that helped me to dig into the programming. It is not enough, of course, however, it will surely give you the basics. Oh, and they've got some apps for your smartphone as well.</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
          <td><span>Learn Enough</span></td>
          <td><a href="https://www.learnenough.com/" target="blank">https://www.learnenough.com/</a></td>
          <td>Some pretty easy manuals that included Linux CLI, Text Editors, GitHub itself and HTML. Be aware that some of them may be not ready yet. Anyway, they are cool at least because they make you believe you can do it.</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
          <td><span>W3Schools</span></td>
          <td><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="blank">https://www.w3schools.com/</a></td>
          <td>You can't keep all the things about HTML and CSS in your head. Even if so, it can be quite difficult. So sometimes it is better to google it. And prior to googling it, you can always try lurking this extremely helpful website</td>
         </tr>
	 <tr>
          <td><span>LinuxCommand</span></td>
          <td><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/index.php" target="blank">http://linuxcommand.org/</a></td>
          <td>My first introduction to Linux can be tightly related to this website, and though I gave up pretty quickly, I still think I should come back later and learn some more.</td>
